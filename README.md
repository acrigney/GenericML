# GenericML
GenericML is designed to enable rapid ML model development and human in the loop AI as with the framework it is easy to build  applications where domain experts can train and test models themselves on their own laptops on GB of multi-dimensional data in minutes!  No expensive VMs, MLOps, and data scientists required. 80% of ML Projects Fail .

# GenericML — Architecture, Philosophy, and Technical Whitepaper

This repository contains the official documentation, architecture notes, 
and conceptual framework for **GenericML**, a proprietary machine-learning 
framework designed to enable **domain experts** to build, train, and deploy 
ML models without Python, MLOps, containers, or heavy infrastructure.

GenericML was created to solve the **impedance mismatch** between 
data science and software engineering, and to empower real-world experts 
in healthcare, finance, energy, mining, biotech, and environmental science 
to build models on their own laptops — quickly, safely, and cost-effectively.

🚫 **No SDK code is published here.**  
GenericML is proprietary commercial software.

✔ This repo publishes the **ideas**, **architecture**, **philosophy**, and 
**whitepapers** so that enterprises, researchers, and partners can evaluate 
the framework and understand the design principles.
