# Why GenericML is Proprietary

GenericML is designed as an enterprise-grade framework that provides 
a competitive edge to clients across healthcare, energy, biotech, 
mining, trading, forestry, and public-sector AI.

Releasing the SDK as open-source would:
- Reduce the competitive advantage of our clients.
- Allow competitors to replicate core design innovations.
- Undermine commercial licensing agreements.
- Create security and compliance risks.
- Slow the evolution of the core technology.

Therefore, GenericML remains **closed-source**, and only the 
conceptual and architectural documentation is published publicly.

This allows:
✔ Transparent evaluation  
✔ Academic/discussion freedom  
✔ Establishment of prior art  
✔ Community awareness  

Without:
✘ Exposing intellectual property  
✘ Enabling competitive cloning  
✘ Creating risk for enterprise clients  

GenericML is designed to give enterprises a decisive advantage in AI/ML 
without the complexity and fragility of Python-centric pipelines, 
heavy MLOps, or GPU-dependent AutoML frameworks.

Releasing the SDK as open-source would:
- eliminate competitive advantage for our clients,
- allow competitors to replicate core design strategies,
- reduce enterprise willingness to adopt the platform,
- undermine commercial licensing models,
- introduce fragmentation and unofficial forks,
- create security, compliance, and IP risks.

By keeping the SDK private:
✔ Clients retain a structural advantage in their industry  
✔ Architecture remains coherent and unified  
✔ Performance optimizations remain exclusive  
✔ Security posture stays controlled  
✔ The innovation cycle stays rapid and focused  

The **ideas**, **philosophy**, and **architecture** are open for discussion.  
The **actual implementation** remains proprietary.

This approach mirrors the model used successfully by:
- Palantir Foundry  
- SAS  
- C3.ai  
- FICO  
- Bloomberg ML  
- Snowflake ML  

Open ideas, closed engines.
