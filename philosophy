# Why GenericML is Proprietary

GenericML is designed as an enterprise-grade framework that provides 
a competitive edge to clients across healthcare, energy, biotech, 
mining, trading, forestry, and public-sector AI.

Releasing the SDK as open-source would:
- Reduce the competitive advantage of our clients.
- Allow competitors to replicate core design innovations.
- Undermine commercial licensing agreements.
- Create security and compliance risks.
- Slow the evolution of the core technology.

Therefore, GenericML remains **closed-source**, and only the 
conceptual and architectural documentation is published publicly.

This allows:
✔ Transparent evaluation  
✔ Academic/discussion freedom  
✔ Establishment of prior art  
✔ Community awareness  

Without:
✘ Exposing intellectual property  
✘ Enabling competitive cloning  
✘ Creating risk for enterprise clients
